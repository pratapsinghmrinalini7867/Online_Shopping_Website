# Online_Shopping_Website
This is an ecommerce website where user can shop online, do online payment, track orders, record of previous orders, and user profile. User authentication is done and a forgot password facility is provided as well in case user forgot their password. I had used React and Material UI to make a better UI & UX and for backend I have used Node JS and Express JS. I had worked on Nodemailer to send mails on Registration or in case of forgot password.I also worked on stats on admin panel so that admin can keep a watch on website. Further I will add some more functionality in future like User have a return option for product and can add reviews.
