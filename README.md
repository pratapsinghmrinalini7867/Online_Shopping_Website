# Online_Shopping_Website
This is an e-commerce website where users can shop online, do online payments, track orders, and record previous orders, and user profiles. User authentication is done and a forgot password facility is provided as well in case the user forgot their password. I used React and Material UI to make a better UI & UX and for the backend, I have used Node JS and Express JS. I had worked on Nodemailer to send emails on registred email id or in case of forgetting a password. I also worked on stats on the admin panel so that the admin can keep a watch on the website. Further, I will add some more functionality in the future like users having a return option for products and can add reviews.
